# LMU : Legendre Memory Unit
Pytorch implementation of LMU paper based on [Legendre Memory Unit](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9689-legendre-memory-units-continuous-time-representation-in-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf) paper and its [Keras implementation](https://github.com/abr/neurips2019). 

The implementation isn't optimized yet but accuracy for 100 epochs is reproduced. I copied datasets generation code used in official implementation to compare my results.
